# 👋 Hey, I'm Oorakathan

- I'm not your typical dev.
- I don't code everything — I build the **logic** behind things.
- I create small, working systems that **solve** real problems.
- I’m learning everything, not to master, but to **connect**.
- This is not the path of a developer. This is the path of a **creator**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do Best

- 🧩 Break big problems into working steps
- ⚙️ Design systems using minimal but meaningful code
- 🤖 Work with Deep Learning, Scripting, Prompt Engineering
- 🛠️ Automate, Fix, and Rebuild tech that others give up on

## 🌍 My Philosophy

> "If it works, don’t touch it — unless it makes money or meaning."

I believe in building things that matter — not just finishing things for the sake of it.  
I work fast, smart, and with intent.

## 💡 Final Word

> _The world wasn’t built by people who stuck to one boat._  
> _It was built by those who saw all the boats, and then built a bridge._

Let me be that bridge.
